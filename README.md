<b>Focus:</b> Provable, immutable audit logging of ML model predictions for bias and fairness validation.

<b>Core Problem Solved: </b>

Provides a verifiable governance layer for Machine Learning. It detects subtle shifts in model behavior (data drift, concept drift, ethical bias) by cryptographically linking every input, output, and fairness metric to an immutable audit chain. This is crucial for regulatory compliance and responsible AI deployment.

<b>The Solution Mechanism (Python): </b>

A class that logs every prediction request with metadata and generates a unique, verifiable hash for the entire record before forwarding the event to an immutable storage system (mocked here).
